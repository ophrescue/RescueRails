            <h1>Make a gift. Save a life today.</h1>
            <p>Your gift to Operation Paws for Homes will immediately help us to save dogs in need!</p>

            <p>OPH depends on donations from generous people like you to provide the medical, transportation, fostering, and adoption services needed to place 1,200 homeless dogs in forever homes each year.</p>

            <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-large" href="/donations/new">Donate</a></p>

            <p>Our rescued dogs are cared for throughout their adoption journey, from before they leave the shelter in the transport van to the day they’re welcomed with open arms by their adopters. Adoption fees help offset our expenses, but do not cover all of the services that are needed and provided by OPH. </p>
