                <h2>About Our International Partnerships</h2>
                <p>Since 2013, OPH has partnered with international rescue organizations to expand our efforts globally.
                OPH believes in helping deserving dogs regardless of circumstances or location - in our eyes, rescue
                has no borders or boundaries. Rescuing internationally comes with a myriad of unique challenges. For
                instance, in India, temperatures can reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, which exposes dogs
                to the risk of dehydration, heat stroke, and kidney failure. Additionally, Turks and Caicos is susceptible
                to natural disasters, which has displaced dogs and destroyed the already limited resources shelters
                have at their disposal. While there are horrific cases of abuse and neglect
                stateside, we could not turn our back to those animals in need abroad.</p>

                <p>OPH is very selective about our organization partners to ensure the dogs slated for international
                adoptions are screened thoroughly for medical issues and temperament. Like all our dogs, our
                international dogs are matched with volunteer foster homes before being adopted into permanent,
                loving placements.</p>

                <p>We are proud to partner with Kannan Animal Welfare in India and the Turks and Caicos SPCA.</p>
