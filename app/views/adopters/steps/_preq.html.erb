            <span>OPH has little or no definitive information about each pet's behavior history.  We share as much information as we can collect from our shelter partners and observations from our fosters to help you make the best decision for your home.  Pets can behave differently depending on the environment, so your experience with a newly adopted pet may differ from what our fosters have observed. It will likely take 30-45 days for a pet  to fully adjust to living in your home, so patience and understanding will be keys to a successful adoption. </span>
