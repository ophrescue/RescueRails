        <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://radardogs.org/">Raising Aid for Dogs At Risk (RADAR)</a></strong> provides funding
        to support shelter dogs who are least likely to get adopted (e.g., older dogs, black dogs, special-needs dogs,
        and heartworm positive and medical-needs dogs), regardless of breed. Their focus is primarily on smaller,
        overcrowded, and underfunded rural shelters in Appalachia and the Southeast. OPH works with partner shelters
        to identify dogs in need, especially heartworm positive dogs, and secures funding from RADAR to get treatment.

        critically ill, and injured members of the U.S. Armed Forces by providing trained assistance dogs to these individuals.
        OPH identifies shelter dogs and puppies that demonstrate confidence, a strong interest in people, exceptional focus,
        trainability, and treat motivation. When a dog or puppy displays these attributes, OPH reaches out to Semper K9.
        Their expert completes an assessment of the candidate, and if the dog passes, OPH donates the dog to Semper K9.
        All dogs who enter their training program help veterans with mobility issues and PTSD, improving their quality of
        life by assisting with emotional support and activities of daily living.
